  Description: Our sensors have picked up multiple noisy signals on broad spectrum
    of radio frequencies. We should perform more detailed analysis to reveal what
    kind communication methods native population uses for civilian and military purposes

  StudyResult: "We have analyzed wide spectrum of radio frequencies to identify possible
    communication methods. Amazingly, local population has already discovered radio
    communications and apparently uses it widely for communication purposes. Besides
    using basically unencrypted channels, they use planets ionosphere for bouncing
    low-frequency radio waves for high-distance communication. We\u2019ve also detected
    unusual frequency-modulated bursts of signals. Further studies might reveal more
    about these signals, however we will need more time and resources for that"
