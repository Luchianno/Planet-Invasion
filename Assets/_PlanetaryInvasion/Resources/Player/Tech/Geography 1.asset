  StudyResult: "We have performed initial observations of the planet landscape.\n\nThis
    planet has one major landmass centered around the south pole area.  It has an
    average surface temperature of about 44\xB0 Kelvin.  Its average temperature has
    been rising over the last millennium, and it experiences high levels of geological
    activity all over the planet.  Easily-mined metals are limited to a few good spots."
