  Description: "<size=30><b>The beginning</b></size>\r\nLOG \u25AE\u25AE\u25AE\u25AE:\u25AE\u25AE:\u25AE\u25AE
    - 21:05\r\n    You arrived. It was quite a long journey, but most of the cryocapsules
    have survived. The ships are [DATA EXPUNGED] operational.\r\n    Surprisingly,
    this planet has some kind sentient life forms on the surface. First orbital photos
    show clear signs of population center, roads and irrigation systems. Dark side
    of planet always shines with thousands of tiny blinking lights. It almost feels
    like home. However, the continent contours are not the same. Tints of clouds is
    a bit different. The Sun is more yellow than usual. It feels alien. It is not
    yours. But soon it will be.\r\n    Orders of high command are clear. You have
    to establish control of the [DATA EXPUNGED].\r\n    The expedition has limited
    resources/reinforcements. Use them wisely.\r\n    You might want to consider gathering
    more information about local environment, atmosphere and population. Anything
    might be useful for your tasks.\r"
